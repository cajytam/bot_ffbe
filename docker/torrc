# This provides a port for our script to talk with. If you set this then be
# sure to also set either CookieAuthentication *or* HashedControlPassword!
#
# You could also use ControlSocket instead of ControlPort, which provides a
# file based socket. You don't need to have authentication if you use
# ControlSocket. For this example however we'll use a port.
ControlPort 9051
SocksPort 0.0.0.0:9050

# Setting this will make Tor write an authentication cookie. Anything with
# permission to read this file can connect to Tor. If you're going to run
# your script with the same user or permission group as Tor then this is the
# easiest method of authentication to use.

CookieAuthentication 1

# Alternatively we can authenticate with a password. To set a password first
# get its hash...
#
# % tor --hash-password "QQmArEDXUPCchHJ2mo"
# 16:E600ADC1B52C80BB6022A0E999A7734571A451EB6AE50FED489B72E3DF
#
# ... and use that for the HashedControlPassword in your torrc.

HashedControlPassword 16:3DF865E0B42A9C326078D76B6E2BD50225CAA07306A993BA9D4DA8CB4C
